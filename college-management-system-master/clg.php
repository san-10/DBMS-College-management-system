  <h1>ENGINEEER</h1>
  <p>Engineer is the Annual Technical Symposium of NITK Surathkal and is one of the largest of its kind in India. Started in 2005 as an amalgamation of many technical fests held in NITK Surathkal by its various student clubs, Engineer has grown in leaps and bounds over the years. It is held over 4 days in the second half of the month of October and has consistently attracted participants from all over India. A Penrose Triangle is used as its logo with the tagline 'Think.Create.Engineer'.</p>

 <p>In its previous editions, Engineer brought organizations such as CERN, MIT Media and Bell labs while catering to a participation pool of over 6000 students from 150 colleges across 65 countries. </p>

 <p>Many technical and entrepreneurship events are held during the fest, including quizzes, Coding marathons, RC car racing and the like. These are broadly classified into various Branch Events. Apart from this, Workshops in a variety of fields are also held. To highlight the social responsibility of Engineers, social/environmental awareness initiatives are undertaken under the banner of SCE(Socially Conscious Engineering). Technites is another major attraction, showcasing the beauty of technology after dark. </p>

 <p>Guest speakers of past editions have included Richard Stallman, Sam Pitroda, Dr. Devi Shetty, Sir Anthony James Leggett, Ankit Fadia and other personalities. </p>

  <h1>INCIDENT</h1>
  <p>Incident is the second largest cultural festival of South India. It is now a permanent mark on the calendar, during the months of February - March and attracts over 25000 footfalls every year. This huge ingress is justified, as Incident or 'Inci' is replete with a mind-boggling array of things to do and see. It has featured amazing performances by artistes of calibre likef KK, Kunal Ganjawala, Sunidhi Chauhan, Javed Ali and Salim-Sulaiman, as well as bands such as Indian Ocean, Motherjane, Swarathma and Led Zeppelica. International performing artistes like Roy Zaltsman and The Turbans have also performed at incident in the World Fest, held for the first time in 2014.</p>

<p>There are events to participate in - Haute Couture, Promenade, Slam Dunk, Centre Stage, Bandish... to name a few. There are workshops for those who want to learn, quizzes for those who already know it all and Crossfade -the DJ night- for the party freaks. And of course, there is always the beach inviting you to relax or frolic with friends or even go parasailing, if you are adventurous. Now that's something you don't find everywhere.  Incident is a terrific carnival, something no one would want to miss, because when it comes to Incident, there is something in it for everybody.</p>
